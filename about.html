        <p>We decided to open our latest location in Mark Zuckerburg's MetaVerse
            We went this route because we believe in the blockchain and understand
            the importance of things NFTs and Dodgecoin. Why eat normal food when
            you can enjoy a tasty NFT of food?! Obviously you will need one of our 
            limited edition admission tokens to enter our Metaverse location, but 
            I'm sure you can scavenge up some loose ethereum to purchase the token. 
            You don't want to miss out on our newest Fried Rice NFT to show off to 
            your friends. Yummy Yummy Blockchain!
